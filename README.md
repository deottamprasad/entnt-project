# üíº TalentFlow: A Mini Hiring Platform (Front-End)

**TalentFlow** is a high-fidelity, **frontend-only React application** that simulates a modern Applicant Tracking System (ATS) used by HR teams.  
It‚Äôs a **backend-less project** that mimics a real REST API experience using **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** and stores all data locally in the browser using **IndexedDB (Dexie.js)**.

This project fulfills a detailed technical assignment with complex modules and advanced features like **drag-and-drop**, **data virtualization**, **optimistic updates**, and **persistent local storage**.

## üìò Overview

TalentFlow offers HR professionals an interactive platform to manage **job openings**, **candidates**, and **assessments** within a simulated hiring workflow.

The goal is to demonstrate advanced front-end engineering concepts using **React**, focusing on scalability, UX polish, and efficient state handling without relying on a backend.

## üöÄ Core Features

### 1. Job Management

- Add, edit, and delete job postings.
- Display all jobs in a paginated and searchable list.
- Filter jobs by department, status, or creation date.

### 2. Candidate Pipeline

- Manage candidates associated with each job.
- Visualize hiring stages with a **drag-and-drop Kanban board**.
- View, edit, and tag candidates with notes or @mentions.

### 3. Assessment Builder

- Create and manage skill assessments for job roles.
- Build questionnaires dynamically (MCQs, descriptive, etc.).
- Track question categories and difficulty levels.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Application Flow & Component Breakdown

### App & Routing (`src/App.js`)

- Uses **React Router DOM** for structured routing.
- Core routes:
  - `/jobs` ‚Üí Jobs dashboard
  - `/jobs/:id` ‚Üí Job details with candidate list
  - `/candidates` ‚Üí All candidates view
  - `/candidates/:id` ‚Üí Candidate details
  - `/assessments` ‚Üí Assessment builder

---

### Module 1: Jobs Dashboard (`src/pages/Jobs/JobsList.js`)

- Displays job cards with metadata (title, department, openings).
- Features pagination, filters, and search.
- Supports ‚ÄúCreate New Job‚Äù modal for adding entries.

---

### Module 2: Job Details (`src/pages/Jobs/JobDetail.js`)

- Shows job info, description, and active candidate pipeline.
- Integrates the **Candidate List View** inside the details page.
- Allows HRs to move candidates across stages (drag-and-drop).

---

### Module 3: Assessment Builder (`src/pages/Assessments/Builder.js`)

- A form-based tool for building and saving assessments.
- Question types include multiple choice and descriptive.
- Each assessment is tied to a specific job or department.

---

### Module 4: Candidates Dashboard (`src/pages/Candidates/CandidateList.js`)

- Lists all candidates across all jobs.
- Uses **react-virtualized** for fast rendering.
- Provides filters (status, job applied for, experience).

---

### Module 5: Candidate Details (`src/pages/Candidates/CandidateDetail.js`)

- Displays detailed information on a selected candidate.
- Includes Notes Section with `@mention` autocomplete.
- Integrates candidate status and history.

---

## üß© Architecture & Technical Decisions

### 1. The Backend-less Architecture

- Built around **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** to intercept API requests.
- Simulates endpoints like `/jobs`, `/candidates`, `/assessments`.
- Stores and retrieves data using **Dexie.js (IndexedDB)**.
- Enables fully offline operation without real backend.

### 2. State Management

- Local state managed using **React Context** + **useReducer**.
- Each module (Jobs, Candidates, Assessments) has its own slice.
- Ensures predictable, modular updates and reactivity.

### 3. Performance: List Virtualization

- Implemented using **react-virtualized List**.
- Efficiently renders thousands of candidates without lag.
- Dynamic row height support for responsive layouts.

### 4. Drag-and-Drop (DND)

- Implemented via **react-beautiful-dnd**.
- Enables rearranging candidates between hiring stages.
- Smooth animations and instant local persistence.

### 5. Advanced UI: `@mention` Notes Field

- Implemented via **react-mentions**.
- Supports @tagging HR team members in candidate notes.
- Styled for consistent look and improved usability.
